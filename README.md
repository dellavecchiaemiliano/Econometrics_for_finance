# Econometrics_for_finance
Second year, first semester of master's degree "finance and insurance" with curriculum "financial risk and data analysis". Three projects: the first one is a short assignment on the basics of python programming; the second one is related to the evaluation of the main measures which indentify portfolio risk, specifically once I built a portfolio of stocks, I evaluated sharpe ratio, sortino ratio, max drawdawn and calmar ratio; The third is an optional project that I want to bring, for the final oral exam, about a convolutional neural networks on the academic dataset "Fashion-MNIST", by using the library pytorch.
